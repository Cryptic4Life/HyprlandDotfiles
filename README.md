# Hyprland Dotfiles

This repository stores my Hyprland dotfiles. Feel free to use them however you like!

## Installation

I'm using [**stow**](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to keep all my dotfiles in a single directory. If you want to use these dotfiles in your own machine, install `stow` and run this command inside the cloned directory:

```
stow */
```

Stow will create symlinks to the dotfiles in all the appropiate places in the file system! Note that it will not apply wallpapers, themes, or other external assets. You will need to download and set them up separately.

## Installing specific dotfiles

If you only want to apply specific dotfiles, instead run the following command:

```
stow <folder_name>
```
